# Supervisor ISA

This is the step 4 of the book [_Writing a RISC-V Emulator from Scratch in 10 Steps_](./), whose goal is running [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv), a small Unix-like OS, in your emulator in the final step.

The source code is available at d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/step4/.

## Goal of This Page

In the end of this page, we can execute parts of supervisor ISA, `mret`, and `sret`. These instructions are used to return from traps in M-mode, S-mode, or U-mode respectively.
