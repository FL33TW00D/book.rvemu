# PLIC \(a platform-level interrupt controller\) and CLINT \(a core-local interrupter\)

This is step 6 of the book [_Writing a RISC-V Emulator from Scratch in 10 Steps_](./), whose goal is running [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv), a small Unix-like OS, in your emulator in the final step.

The source code is available at d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/step6/.

## Goal of This Page

In the end of this page, we can support a platform-level interrupt controller \(PLIC\) and a core-local interrupter \(CLINT\) as CPU's peripheral devices.
