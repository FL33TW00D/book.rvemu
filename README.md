# Writing a RISC-V Emulator from Scratch in 10 Steps

## Introduction

This is the book for writing a 64-bit RISC-V emulator from scratch in Rust. It shows us how to implement an emulator in 10 steps. You can run [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv), a simple Unix-like OS, in your emulator in the final step.

You'll learn the following basic computer architecture from making an emulator in Rust:

* Basic RISC-V architecture
* How to write code in Rust language
* Privilege levels
* Exceptions
* Interrupts
* Peripheral devices
* Virtual memory system

The source code is available at [d0iasm/rvemu-for-book](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu-for-book).

CongratulationsðŸŽ‰ Now you can run xv6 in your emulator!
