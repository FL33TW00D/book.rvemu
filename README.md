# Writing a RISC-V Emulator from Scratch in 10 Days

## Introduction

This is the book for writing a RISC-V emulator from scratch in Rust. It shows us how to implement an emulator step by step in 10 days. You can run [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv), a simple Unix-like OS, in your emulator in the final day.

You'll learn the basic computer architecture from making an emulator in Rust:

* Basic RISC-V architecture
* How to write code in Rust language
* Privilege levels
* Exceptions
* Interrupts
* Peripheral devices
