# Writing a RISC-V Emulator from Scratch in 10 Steps

## Introduction

This is the book for writing a 64-bit RISC-V emulator from scratch in Rust. It shows us how to implement an emulator in 10 steps. You can run [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv), a simple Unix-like OS, in your emulator in the final step.

You'll learn the following basic computer architecture from making an emulator in Rust:

* Basic RISC-V architecture
* How to write code in Rust language
* Privilege levels
* Exceptions
* Interrupts
* Peripheral devices

The source code is available at [d0iasm/rvemu-for-book](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu-for-book).

| Step | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| Step 1 | [Setup and Implement Two Instructions](setup-and-implement-two-instructions.md) |
| Step 2 | [RV64I ISA](rv64i-isa.md) |
| Step 3 | [Control and Status Registers](control-and-status-registers.md) |
| Step 4 | [Supervisor ISA](supervisor-isa.md) |
| Step 5 | [Exceptions](exceptions.md) |
| Step 6 | UART \(a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter\) |
| Step 7 | PLIC \(a platform-level interrupt controller\) |
| Step 8 | Interrupts |
| Step 9 | CLINT \(a core-local interruptor\) |
| Step 10 | Virtio |

CongratulationsðŸŽ‰ Now you can run xv6 in your emulator!
