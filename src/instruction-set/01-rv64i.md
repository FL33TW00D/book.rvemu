# RV64I Base Integer Instruction Set

## Goal of This Page

In the end of this page, we can execute [the sample file](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/blob/master/step02/fib.c) that calculates [a Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in our emulator. We will support RV64 ISAs, the base integer instruction set a 64-bit architecture, to calculate a Fibonacci number.

Sample binary files are also available at [d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/step02/](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/tree/master/step02). We successfully see the result of the 10th Fibonacci number when we execute the sample binary file `fib.bin`.

```text
// fib.c contains the following C code and fib.bin is the build result of it:
// int fib(int n);
// int main() {
//   return fib(10); // Calculate the 10th fibonacci number.
// }
// int fib(int n) {
//   if (n == 0 || n == 1)
//     return n;
//   else
//     return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2));
// }

$ cargo run fib.bin
...           
x12=0x0 x13=0x0 x14=0x1 x15=0x37 // x15 should contain 55 (= 10th fibonacci number).
```

## RV64I: Base Integer Instruction Set

RV64I is a base integer instruction set for the 64-bit architecture, which builds upon the RV32I variant. RV64I shares most of the instructions with RV32I but the width of registers is different and there are a few additional instructions only in RV64I.

In this step, we're going to implement 47 instructions \(35 instructions from RV32I and 12 instructions from RV64I\). We've already implemented `add` and `addi` so we'll skip them. Also, we'll skip implementing `fence`, `ecall`, and `ebreak` for now. I'll cover `ecall` and `ebreak` in the following step and won't explain `fence`. The `fence` instruction is a type of barrier instruction to apply an ordering constraint on memory operations issued before and after it. We don't need it since our emulator is a single core system and doesn't reorder memory operations \(out-of-order execution\).

Fig 2.1 and Fig 2.2 are the lists for RV32I and RV64I, respectively. We're going to implement all instructions in the figures.

## Instructions List

The following table is a brief explanation for each instruction. The book won't describe the details of each instruction but will indicate points to be noted when you implement instructions. In addition, you can see the implementation in [d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/step02/src/cpu.rs](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/blob/master/step02/src/cpu.rs) and description in _Chapter 2 RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set_ and _Chapter 5 RV64I Base Integer Instruction Set_ in [the unprivileged specification](https://riscv.org/specifications/isa-spec-pdf/).

**Points to be noted**:

* Arithmetic operations are done by wrapping\_\* functions to avoid an overflow.
* Sign-extended is done by casting from a smaller signed integer to a larger signed integer.
* The amount for 64-bit shift operations is encoded in the lower 6 bits in an immediate, and the amount for 32-bit shift operations is encoded in the lower 5 bits.

## Testing

We're going to test instructions we implemented in this step by calculating [a Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) and check if the registers are expected values. I prepared a sample binary file available at [d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/step02/](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/tree/master/step02). Download the [fib.bin](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/blob/master/step02/fib.bin) file and execute it in your emulator.

Calculating a Fibonacci number is actually not enough to test all RV64I instructions, so it perhaps be better to use [riscv/riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests) to make sure if your implementation is correct. However, it's not obvious how to use riscv-tests so I'll skip to use the test in this book for the sake of simplicity. If you are interested in using riscv-tests, [the test file in rvemu](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu/blob/master/tests/rv64_user.rs) may be helpful.

```text
// fib.c contains the following C code and fib.bin is the build result of it:
// int fib(int n);
// int main() {
//   return fib(10); // Calculate the 10th fibonacci number.
// }
// int fib(int n) {
//   if (n == 0 || n == 1)
//     return n;
//   else
//     return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2));
// }

$ cargo run fib.bin
...           
x12=0x0 x13=0x0 x14=0x1 x15=0x37 // x15 should contain 55 (= 10th fibonacci number).
```

### How to Build Test Binary

If you want to execute a bare-metal C program you write, you need to make an ELF binary without any headers because our emulator just starts to execute at the address `0x0` . The [Makefile](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/blob/master/step02/Makefile) helps you build a test binary.

```bash
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -S fib.c
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Wl,-Ttext=0x0 -nostdlib -o fib fib.s
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O binary fib fib.bin
```
