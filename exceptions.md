# Exceptions

This is step 5 of the book [_Writing a RISC-V Emulator from Scratch in 10 Steps_](./), whose goal is running [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv), a small Unix-like OS, in your emulator in the final step.

The source code is available at d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/step05/.

## Goal of This Page

In the end of this page, we support exceptions and can execute `ecall`, `ebreak` and `fence`, parts of the base integer instruction set \(RV64I\). The `ecall` and `ebreak` instructions raise an exception.
