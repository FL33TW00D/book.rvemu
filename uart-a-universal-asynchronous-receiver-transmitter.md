# UART \(a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter\)

This is step 7 of the book [_Writing a RISC-V Emulator from Scratch in 10 Steps_](./), whose goal is running [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv), a small Unix-like OS, in your emulator in the final step.

The source code is available at [d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/step07/](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu-for-book/tree/master/step07).

## Goal of This Page

In the end of this page, we can support a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter \(UART\) as one of CPU's peripheral devices.

## Testing

// TODO: print "Hello, world!" and echoback
